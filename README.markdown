# ripple

ripple is a rich Ruby toolkit for Riak, Basho's distributed database. It consists of three gems:

* `riak-client` (`Riak` namespace) contains a basic wrapper around typical operations, including bucket manipulation, object CRUD, link-walking, and map-reduce.
* `ripple` (`Ripple` namespace) contains an ActiveModel-compatible modeling layer that is inspired by ActiveRecord, DataMapper, and MongoMapper.
* `riak-sessions` contains session stores for Rack and Rails 3 applications.

## Dependencies

`riak-client` requires i18n and either json or yajl-ruby. For higher performance on HTTP requests, install the 'curb' or 'excon' gems. The cache store implementation requires ActiveSupport 3 or later.

`ripple` requires Ruby 1.8.7 or later and versions 3 or above of ActiveModel and ActiveSupport (and their dependencies, including i18n).

`riak-sessions` requires Rack (any version > 1.0), and Rails 3.0 if you want the Rails-specific session store.

Development dependencies are handled with bundler. Install bundler (`gem install bundler`) and run this command in each sub-project to get started:

``` bash
$ bundle install
```

Run the RSpec suite using `bundle exec`:

``` bash
$ bundle exec rake spec
```

## Basic Example

``` ruby
require 'riak'

# Create a client interface
client = Riak::Client.new

# Create a client interface that uses Excon
client = Riak::Client.new(:http_backend => :Excon)

# Create a client that uses Protocol Buffers
client = Riak::Client.new(:protocol => "pbc")

# Retrieve a bucket
bucket = client.bucket("doc")  # a Riak::Bucket

# Get an object from the bucket
object = bucket.get("index.html")   # a Riak::RObject

# Change the object's data and save
object.data = "<html><body>Hello, world!</body></html>"
object.store

# Reload an object you already have
object.reload                  # Works if you have the key and vclock, using conditional GET
object.reload :force => true   # Reloads whether you have the vclock or not

# Access more like a hash, client[bucket][key]
client['doc']['index.html']   # the Riak::RObject

# Create a new object
new_one = Riak::RObject.new(bucket, "application.js")
new_one.content_type = "application/javascript" # You must set the content type.
new_one.data = "alert('Hello, World!')"
new_one.store
```

## Map-Reduce Example

``` ruby
# Assuming you've already instantiated a client, get the album titles for The Beatles
results = Riak::MapReduce.new(client).
                add("artists","Beatles").
                link(:bucket => "albums").
                map("function(v){ return [JSON.parse(v.values[0].data).title]; }", :keep => true).run

p results # => ["Please Please Me", "With The Beatles", "A Hard Day's Night", 
          #     "Beatles For Sale", "Help!", "Rubber Soul",
          #     "Revolver", "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", "Magical Mystery Tour", 
          #     "The Beatles", "Yellow Submarine", "Abbey Road", "Let It Be"]
```


## Riak Search Examples

For more information about Riak Search, see [the Basho wiki](http://wiki.basho.com/Riak-Search.html).

``` ruby
# Create a client, specifying the Solr-compatible endpoint
client = Riak::Client.new :solr => "/solr"

# Search the default index for documents
result = client.search("title:Yesterday") # Returns a vivified JSON object
                                          # containing 'responseHeaders' and 'response' keys
result['response']['numFound'] # total number of results
result['response']['start']    # offset into the total result set
result['response']['docs']     # the list of indexed documents

# Search the 'users' index for documents
client.search("users", "name:Sean")

# Add a document to an index
client.index("users", {:id => "sean@basho.com", :name => "Sean Cribbs"}) # adds to the 'users' index

client.index({:id => "index.html", :content => "Hello, world!"}) # adds to the default index

client.index({:id => 1, :name => "one"}, {:id => 2, :name => "two"}) # adds multiple docs

# Remove document(s) from an index
client.remove({:id => 1})             # removes the document with ID 1
client.remove({:query => "archived"}) # removes all documents matching query
client.remove({:id => 1}, {:id => 5}) # removes multiple docs

client.remove("users", {:id => "sean@basho.com"}) # removes from the 'users' index

# Seed MapReduce with search results
Riak::MapReduce.new(client).
        search("users","email:basho").
        map("Riak.mapValuesJson", :keep => true).
        run

# Detect whether a bucket has auto-indexing
client['users'].is_indexed?

# Enable auto-indexing on a bucket
client['users'].enable_index!

# Disable auto-indexing on a bucket
client['users'].disable_index!
```

## Document Model Examples

``` ruby
require 'ripple'

# Documents are stored as JSON objects in Riak but have rich
# semantics, including validations and associations.
class Email
  include Ripple::Document
  property :from,    String, :presence => true
  property :to,      String, :presence => true
  property :sent,    Time,   :default => proc { Time.now }
  property :body,    String
end

email = Email.find("37458abc752f8413e")  # GET /riak/emails/37458abc752f8413e
email.from = "someone@nowhere.net"
email.save                               # PUT /riak/emails/37458abc752f8413e

reply = Email.new
reply.from = "justin@bashoooo.com"
reply.to   = "sean@geeemail.com"
reply.body = "Riak is a good fit for scalable Ruby apps."
reply.save                               # POST /riak/emails (Riak-assigned key)

# Documents can contain embedded documents, and link to other standalone documents 
# via associations using the many and one class methods.
class Person
  include Ripple::Document
  property :name, String
  many :addresses
  many :friends, :class_name => "Person"
  one :account
end

# Account and Address are embeddable documents
class Account
  include Ripple::EmbeddedDocument
  property :paid_until, Time
  embedded_in :person # Adds "person" method to get parent document
end

class Address
  include Ripple::EmbeddedDocument
  property :street, String
  property :city, String
  property :state, String
  property :zip, String
end

person = Person.find("adamhunter")
person.friends << Person.find("seancribbs") # Links to people/seancribbs with tag "friend"
person.addresses << Address.new(:street => "100 Main Street") # Adds an embedded address
person.account.paid_until = 3.months.from_now
```


## Configuration Example

When using Ripple with Rails 3, add ripple to your Gemfile and then run the `ripple` generator.  This will generate a test harness, some MapReduce functions and a configuration file. Example:

```
$ rails g ripple
      create  config/ripple.yml
      create  app/mapreduce
      create  app/mapreduce/contrib.js
      create  app/mapreduce/ripple.js
      create  test/ripple_test_helper.rb
      insert  test/test_helper.rb
      insert  test/test_helper.rb
```

`config/ripple.yml` should contain your Riak connection information, and settings for the test server. Example:

``` yaml
# Configure Riak connections for the Ripple library.
development:
  http_port: 8098
  pb_port: 8087
  host: localhost

# The test environment has additional keys for configuring the
# Riak::TestServer for your test/spec suite:
#
# * bin_dir specifies the path to the "riak" script that you use to
#           start Riak (just the directory)
# * js_source_dir specifies where your custom Javascript functions for
#           MapReduce should be loaded from. Usually app/mapreduce.
test:
  http_port: 9000
  pb_port: 9002
  host: localhost
  bin_dir: /usr/local/bin   # Default for Homebrew.
  js_source_dir: <%%= Rails.root + "app/mapreduce" %>

production:
  http_port: 8098
  pb_port: 8087
  host: localhost
```

`require 'ripple/railtie'` from your `config/application.rb` file to complete the integration.


## How to Contribute

* Fork the project on [Github](http://github.com/seancribbs/ripple).  If you have already forked, use `git pull --rebase` to reapply your changes on top of the mainline. Example:

    ``` bash
    $ git checkout master
    $ git pull --rebase seancribbs master
    ```
* Create a topic branch. If you've already created a topic branch, rebase it on top of changes from the mainline "master" branch. Examples:
  * New branch:

        ``` bash
        $ git checkout -b topic
        ```
  * Existing branch:

        ``` bash
        $ git rebase master
        ```
* Write an RSpec example or set of examples that demonstrate the necessity and validity of your changes. **Patches without specs will most often be ignored. Just do it, you'll thank me later.** Documentation patches need no specs, of course.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix. Make your specs and stories pass (green).
* Run the suite using multiruby or rvm to ensure cross-version compatibility.
* Cleanup any trailing whitespace in your code (try @whitespace-mode@ in Emacs, or "Remove Trailing Spaces in Document" in the "Text" bundle in Textmate).
* Commit, do not mess with Rakefile or VERSION.  If related to an existing issue in the [tracker](http://github.com/seancribbs/ripple/issues), include "Closes #X" in the commit message (where X is the issue number).
* Send me a pull request.
